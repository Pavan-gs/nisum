/* 1)	Query the JOBS table and return a single expression of the form The Job Id for the <job_title’s> job is: <job_id>. 
Take note that the job_title should have an apostrophe and an “s” appended to it to read more naturally. 
A sample of this output for the organization president is: “The Job Id for the President’s job is: AD_PRES.” 
Alias this column expression as “Job Description” using the AS keyword. 

2) Write a query that extracts the JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, and MAX_SALARY columns, as well as an expression called VARIANCE,
which is the difference between the MAX_SALARY and MIN_SALARY values, for each row. 
The result should include only JOB_TITLE values that contain either the word “President” or “Manager.” 
Sort the list in descending order based on the VARIANCE expression. 
If more than one row has the same VARIANCE value, then, sort these rows by JOB_TITLE in reverse alphabetic order. */
